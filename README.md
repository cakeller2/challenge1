# challenge1

This code is a proof of concept of a possible item selling service. 

# Login
When the application is started, the user will be prompted to enter a valid username and then password. At this time, the username and password is hard coded in and can be seen in the code. 
The possible usernames are:
 "student1", "student2", "student3"

The possible passwords are
 "testing1", "testing2", "testing3"

The username and password must have corresponding numbers or it will not work. If the user makes a mistake 3 times, the application will exit. 

# Home

After a successful login, the user will be taken to the home menu. There they will be prompted to choose between buy, sell, view cart, and logout

# Buy

In this menu, the user will be prompted to pick between viewing items for sale, adding an item to cart, or going back to the home menu. If an invalid answer is entered, but system will reject it and ask the user again

If viewing items for sale is selected and the list of items for sale is empty, then the system will inform the user and go back to the previous menu. If the list of items is not empty, the list will be displayed and then the user will be moved back to the previous menu

If adding an item to cart is selected, there is a check for whether the user entered this menu by accident.The system then waits for a valid input. After that, the user enters the number for the item they want to add to their cart.

# Sell

In this menu, the user is prompted to pick between viewing the items that they have listed, add an item to be sold, or to return home. If an invalid answer is entered, but system will reject it and ask the user again

If the user has no items listed for sale, then the system will inform the user and return to the previous menu. If the list of items is not empty, the list will be displayed and then teh user will be moved back to the previous menu.




A teamâ€™s repo must include a Read Me file in their root project folder that summarizes their application
